# Bump attractor model.  Results of simulations
# Nucleus Basalis Stimulation Enhances Working Memory by Stabilizing Stimulus Representations in Primate Prefrontal Cortical Activity

Notebooks for the plots of the figure 6, and the supl 1 and 2.  

In the folder /results we have the .py files to obtain the simulation (running in paralel) as well as the .xlsx files with the results of the simulations.
